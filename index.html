<h3 align="center"> The Badjao Community</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">
Badjao are known as “Sea Gypsies” or Sea Nomads”. They are an ethnic group found along the shores of Mindanao, Borneo, Celebes, and Indonesia. A majority of the Badjaos practice Islam. They are recognized for their artistically woven and colorful sails. The Badjaos lived in stilt houses along the coastlines. Originally they live off the sea by trading and fishing.  Today, the Badjaos have scattered all throughout the country. In Davao City, Badjaos, have been spotted asking for alms along the city’s busy streets. Some of them have engaged in buying and selling pre-loved and imitation shoes. Some of the Badjao have started to form communities along the shores. One of these communities is the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc.
Our mission is to help the Badjao community because the badjao had a long history of displacement due to the loss of their ancestral waters, poverty, and discrimination. Loss of livelihood and state neglect forced many of them to migrate to urban areas. Badjaos have to finance their physiological or survival needs such as food, water, and shelter.  
<br>
<br>
The partner Institution is the Badjao community. The Badjao community’s history
is that the everyday human conditions and the concerns were described as very
poor and dirty, considering 700 people were suffering from these problems they
needed to do something about it. Due to these problems the institution was
formed to provide a better quality of life for the people. But the founding of the
institution didn’t end the problematic situations like that, economic issues, and a
lack of basic needs like food or water, due to the pandemic. Now they have
formed a partnership with ADDU JHS to help resolve these problems.
