<h2>Significance of the project</h2>
<br>
<p align="justify">

a.) The project is important for the partner institution (Badjao community) because this will solve
their issues which is the lack of food security and resources. How this is important because it
allows for the partner institution to have a source of food and income through our project with
their lack of resources we can take advantage of the many plastics within the area that we can
recycle to improve their hygiene.
<br>
<br>
b.) This project is important for the Ateneo students because it will let us learn how to help out
the people that are less fortunate than us. Being able to express the teachings of the Ateneo
school allows us to show the values of an Atenean.
<br>
<br>
c.) The project is important for the public because if more people know about this, they will also
be able to help the Badjao people. This brings to light the problems of the Badjao people to the
public that inspires them to help the community.

<h2> Background of the project</h2>
<br>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<br>
<p>The problem that we identified that the Badjao community is facing right about now is the lack of
physiological needs and the cleanliness of their community. Poverty is a problem that the
Badjao people have had to cope with for a very long time. Because they don't earn enough
money, they have a difficult time affording food and other necessities. This is due to problems
with inadequate sanitation, pollution, a shortage of food and water, and other things. Members
are experiencing physical, emotional, and mental effects because of the said problems, and
because of the lack of income, they can’t pay the hospital bills.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Intervention</h3>
<Br>
<p> Our program/project which is “Planting with limited resources and recycling” can help our
partner institution since it will benefit their needs for food and also make a good effect on their
environment. The Badjaos also known as the “Sea Gypsies' ' are excellent fishers and live in
huge bodies of water so they catch fish to eat, but because of water pollution catching fish is
getting harder and harder. But through this project, we will be able to help them with their food
source and improve their environment. We can make the most of what we already have by
reusing products like plastics as bottles and plastic utensils as gardening tools by turning them
into easy-to-use pots and utilities. We will need to teach them how to compost food waste, for
example, to better show them how to make the most of their limited resources. Compostable
waste can be used as fertilizer, which is one way to achieve this goal. The lack of food and
resources in their community can be addressed with these solutions, and by making use of the
resources already available to them, implementing this project will be relatively inexpensive.</p>
