<h1 align="center"> Determining the Effective dosage of Eggshells for the growth of lettuce </h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Problem and Hypothesis</h2>
<p>

<br>
Problem: Will Eggshells help the Lactuca Sativa grow healthier and taller? <br>
Hypothesis: If we use Eggshells for Lettuce (Lactuca sativa), then the Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) will grow healthier and taller.	</p>
<br>
<h2>Molecules involved in plant growth</h2>
<br>
<p>
Lipids are necessary for cell and organelle integrity because they act as a hydrophobic barrier for the membrane.
Carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis are well known in plants for their critical role as energy sources and carbon
skeletons for organic compounds and storage. Plant proteins, like proteins in general, play a variety of enzymatic,
structural, and functional roles in photosynthesis, biosynthesis, transport, immunity, and other processes. They also serve as storage
mediums to meet the nutritional and growth requirements of developing seedlings.</p>
<br>
<h2>Our Methodology</h2>
<br>
<p>
Variables:
<br>
<br>

Independent: Use of fertilizer<br>
Dependent: Growth of plant in 30 days<br>
Control: Type of plant, amount of water, amount of soil,
type of soil, amount of sunlight, size of the pot
</p>
<br>
<h3> Setups </h3>
<br>
<p>
Control Set-up:

The control setup will be using 100 ml per weekday. We will use a 6-inch pot, without the use of
fertilizer. After 30 days, we will measure the height of the plant (lettuce).
<br>
Experimental Set-up 1:


The experimental set-up will be using 100ml per weekday and we will use a 6-inch pot,
with the use of fertilizer which will be egg shells. After 30 days, we will measure the height of the plant (lettuce).
<br>
Experimental Set-up 2


The experimental set-up will be using 100ml per weekday and we will use a 6-inch pot,
with the use of fertilizer which will be banana peels. After 30 days, we will measure the height of the plant (lettuce).
<br>
<br>
<h2> Procedure </h2>
<br>
<p>Step 1:Eat the bananas and crack the eggs and gather them separately.<Br>
Step 3:Add 3 eggshells in each pot in experimental set-up 1 and1 Banana peel for each pot in experimental set-up 2.<Br>
Step 4: Add the compost fertilizer (eggshell/Banana Peels) every 3 days.<Br>
Step 5: Water the lettuce with 100 mL every weekday.<Br>
Step 6: Measure the Height of the plant.
